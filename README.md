# Serverless URL Shortener

## TODO

### Try out

- AWS Lambda Layer(s) for Python dependencies
  - pipenv
- GraphQL
- DynamoDB
- Cognito

### Research (and document)

- Test driven development (what would be the scope of test coverage)
  - pytest?
- Debugging
- Serverless staging approach (with team work in mind)
- CI/CD (how to enforce test execution)

### Research (extra)

- Is Async IO used somehow in Python AWS Lambdas? (Any external event loop?)
- Compare Serverless to AWS Amplify?
